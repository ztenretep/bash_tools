# Motivation

While using Nvidia grafic cards one has to deal with two types of software tools and interfaces. These are namely OpenCL
and CUDA. Programming and control of a graphics processing units (GPU) is possible via OpenCL and CUDA.

# OpenCl

OpenCL (Open Computing Language) is a framework for writing programs that can be executed across heterogeneous platforms 
consisting of a central processing unit (CPU) and one ore more graphics processing units (GPUs). OpenCL specifies the
programming language for programming these devices. OpenCL also specifies the application programming interface (API)
to control the platform and execute programs on the device. 

# CUDA
