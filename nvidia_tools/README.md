# Motivation

<p align="justify">While using Nvidia grafic cards one has to deal with two types of software tools and interfaces. These are namely OpenCL
and CUDA. Programming and control of a graphics processing units (GPU) is possible via OpenCL and CUDA.</p>

<p align="justify">OpenCL and CUDA is e.g. used in crypto mining. One or more CPUs works together with one or more GPUs which can be controlled 
using OpenCL and CUDA.</p>

<p align="justify">CUDA supports only NVIDIA devices, while OpenCL is an open standard for different kind of devices.</p>

# OpenCl

<p align="justify">OpenCL (Open Computing Language) is a framework for writing programs that can be executed across
heterogeneous platforms consisting of central processing units (CPUs) and one ore more graphics processing units (GPUs).
OpenCL specifies the programming language for programming these devices. OpenCL also specifies the application programming
interface (API) to control the platform and execute programs on the devices.</p> 

# CUDA

<p align="justify">CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is a parallel computing platform and application programming
interface (API) developed by Nvidia, with which parts of a programme can be processed by the graphics processor unit (GPU).
CUDA is a software layer that gives direct access to the virtual instruction set and the parallel computational elements of
the GPU. CUDA allows software to use certain types of graphics processing units (GPUs) for general purpose processing.
Additional computing capacity is provided in the form of the GPU, whereby the GPU generally works significantly faster than
the central processing unit (CPU) for highly parallelisable program sequences (high data parallelism). CUDA is mainly used
for scientific and technical calculations. Crypto mining is one example of a lot.</p>
