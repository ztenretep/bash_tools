# Motivation

<p align="justify">While using Nvidia grafic cards one has to deal with two types of software tools and interfaces. These are namely OpenCL
and CUDA. Programming and control of a graphics processing units (GPU) is possible via OpenCL and CUDA.</p>

<p align="justify">OpenCL and CUDA is e.g. used in crypto mining. One CPU works together with one or more grafic cards which can be controlled 
by OpenCL and CUDA.</p>

<p align="justify">CUDA supports only NVIDIA devices, while OpenCL is an open standard for different kind systems.</p>

# OpenCl

OpenCL (Open Computing Language) is a framework for writing programs that can be executed across heterogeneous platforms 
consisting of a central processing unit (CPU) and one ore more graphics processing units (GPUs). OpenCL specifies the
programming language for programming these devices. OpenCL also specifies the application programming interface (API)
to control the platform and execute programs on the device. 

# CUDA

CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is a parallel computing platform and application programming interface (API)
that allows software to use certain types of graphics processing units (GPUs) for general purpose processing. CUDA is a
software layer that gives direct access to the virtual instruction set and parallel computational elements of the GPU.
